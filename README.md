## Detailed Description


At my second job, I was involved in an international scientific research project called UVIPOM2 (ULTRA-EFFICIENT WIRELESS POWERED MICRO-ROBOTIC JOINT FOR HEALTH APPLICATIONS). I served as the main person responsible for producing 3D printed components. One of the most challenging tasks I was given involved developing the assembly method of the shafts of the micro-thrust bearings. The difficulty in assembly arose from the fact that the shafts we used had a diameter of no more than 100 micrometers, while the entire bearings could have a diameter of up to 1 mm. 

#### The micro-thrust bearing:

Until that time, the shaft assembly was done by hand, it was extremely difficult task. My goal was to develop a device that not only facilitates everyone's work but also allows for achieving greater precision in assembly than was previously possible.
