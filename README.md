## Detailed Description

At my second job, I was involved in an international scientific research project called UVIPOM2 (ULTRA-EFFICIENT WIRELESS POWERED MICRO-ROBOTIC JOINT FOR HEALTH APPLICATIONS). I served as the main person responsible for producing 3D printed components. One of the most challenging tasks I was given involved developing the assembly method of the shafts of the micro-thrust bearings. The difficulty in assembly arose from the fact that the shafts we used had a diameter of no more than 100 micrometers, while the entire bearings could have a diameter of up to 1 mm. 

#### The micro-thrust bearing:

Until that time, the shaft assembly was done by hand, it was extremely difficult task. My goal was to develop a device that not only facilitates everyone's work but also allows for achieving greater precision in assembly than was previously possible.

## Work at laboratory 
During my work in the laboratory, I participated in conducting tribological research on miniature ball bearings. For this purpose, we utilized highly precise force and torque measurement systems. Among my tasks were also:

- Developing a methodology for measuring the influence of magnetic force acting on the bearing
- Conducting friction force tests on bearings
- Upgrading assembly and measurement equipment
- 3D modeling and 3D printing (FDM)
- Creating technical documentation for manufacturing
- Testing and servicing equipment (CNC milling machine, 3D printer, CO2 laser)
- Electroplating coatings
- Investigating the influence of coatings on friction force
- Data analysis
- Making controllers for stepper motors used in different project in the laboratory

I was given opportunity for representing Wasraw Univesity of Technology on 16th International Invention and Innovation Show INTARGÂ® 2023.

## Micro-robotic gripper

### Aim of the project

Design a device that will precisely pick up the micro-shaft of the thrust bearing and allow for an easier assembly process of the entire bearing. I aimed for it to be easily controlled, the optimal choice for that would a joystick due to its intuitive control interface and the built-in button that would allow for additional functionality if needed. The micro-robotic gripper would be attached to the Cartesian XYZ robot with a high-precision linear actuators, as shown below.
